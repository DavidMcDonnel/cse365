We originally started working on a tetris game, however we ran into many
issues as detailed in the README.txt of the tetris folder. So instead we have
also completed the carry look ahead adder. We made one 4 bit version of the
chip as well as two 16 bit versions, one that demonstrates scalability of the
4 bit version while losing some speed, and another that focuses on speed. To
write a 32 or 64 bit version without utilizing the 4 or 16 bit versions of 
the chip would require an exponential increase in the amount of code to write,
so we will not be doing that, though the way our code is laid out shows
how it could be done.
